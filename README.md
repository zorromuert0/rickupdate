RICK UPDATE
"Automating the mundane because you're too lazy to type three commands."

RickUpdate is a Python-based CLI utility that automates the boring process of updating your Linux system. It detects your distribution, runs the necessary upgrade and cleanup commands, and provides a running commentary from the smartest (and meanest) man in the multiverse.

A NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER (RICK)

"Listen, Morty. I built a script.

It updates your computer. That's it. It runs sudo apt update and upgrade and cleans up your garbage dependencies so I don't have to look at your messy file system.

I don't know why you need this. You should know how to maintain your own kernel, but clearly, you're busy... I don't know, staring at a wall? Whatever. Just run the .deb file and let me do the work. And don't break anything."
